# NewLands MC Wiki

## Host

NewLandsMC was hosted on a Rocky Linux machine. Start with a standard installation of Rocky Linux and then use this repo to identify all config changes, packages to install, and users to create to get the host ready: https://github.com/newlandsmc/host

## Plugins

NewLandsMC used a collection of public, premium, and custom plugins. A list of the plugins installed is available here: https://github.com/newlandsmc/wiki/tree/main/servers

Most custom plugins have repositories in this org and can be compiled from source.

## Configs

Every server has a repo in this org that was regularly synced with the host. It is therefore a backup of all the configs that were running live on that server.

Newlands survival - https://github.com/newlandsmc/newlands-survival1201
Newlands creative - https://github.com/newlandsmc/creative-server
Newlands lobby - https://github.com/newlandsmc/lobby-server
Newlands proxy - https://github.com/newlandsmc/proxy-server

There are also repos for the semivanilla servers.

## Data

Player/world data was not stored in github. Backups were kept locally. From 12/14/23 to 1/12/24 these backups are available to the public here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZcH51v6ASBs4CDjqqf8Hr3rp2y53I5Kr?usp=drive_link

You can start a server without this data, it will just be a fresh new server instead of a restore of NewLandsMC.
