# Concept

## Information dump until I get around to organizing this further:

\* soandso leaves on a long adventure

\* soandso returns with a \<large\> bounty

-----

Rewards for re-joining. Nothing if you rejoin within 2 hours of leaving.

Better reward longer you are gone.

-----

When you first join you spawn somewhere randomly.

You see a message (not on screen) that says you randomly wake up somewhere strange.

Basic essentials are on your inventory, or around you?

-----

Chat is disabled when you join.

Can be enabled with /chat enable(/disable) - need a message in chat explaining this.

Message in chat:

You awake somewhere strange.

What is that book in your inventory?

(Chat is disabled. You can enable it with "/chat enable")

-----

When you rejoin a second time then a message appears on your screen welcoming you back.

Chat is enabled when you rejoin?

-----

/home for 3 homes.

5 second cooldown on teleporting.

-----

A plugin that let's people view other people's stats and can publish it on the website

Dynmap (newer better version)

-----

Random events around the world? Random coordinates? What would the events be?

-----

Random rewards from enemies? Random stronger enemies around the world?

-----

Rewards plugin:
- Tracks how long players have been offline
- Provides them a reward when they come back online
- Rewards are configurable - multiple time tiers (E.G. offline 2 hours, offline 6 hours, offline 24 hours, etc)
- Rewards are random - (weighted items are randomly selected to match weight of reward tier)
- Rewards are provided as a chest that spawns near them when they log in (must replace an air block. If can't find a good place, then a message in chat says "to claim reward, please use /claimreward" and command will open a GUI instead)
- Chests cannot have items added to them
- Chests disappear once all items are removed
- Chests disappear when a user logs off and respawns near them again when they log back in if they didn't take their reward
- If they have accumulated multiple rewards, they are all added to the same chest (if chest is full, error in chat - no more rewards can be given until they claim their current rewards)
