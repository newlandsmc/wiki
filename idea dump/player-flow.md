# Player Flow

What should a player's day-to-day experience on the server be?

## First Join

When a player first joins the server, they spawn somewhere random within the survival overworld. This should feel like they are just waking up for the first time somewhere strange, they don't know where they are or how they got there.

It might be cool to spawn a campfire near them that if they don't take down will indicate to others that someone has recently spawned there? Issue: Campfire littering the world after a while. Potential solution: Auto-remove campfires, or have pre-set campfires to use for all spawns?

Also might spawn a chest near them that has some basic essentials?

They should get a book, whether in their inventory, or in a chest, that initiates the story? Issue: players don't tend to read books.

Chat will be disabled when they first join so they don't get distracted by the chat and can be immersed in the story more. The messages when they first join should be:
- You awake somewhere strange.
- What is that book in your inventory?
- (Chat is disabled. You can enable it with "/chat enable")

\<We should add more to this first-join experience to make it more rail-roaded and story-driven\>

## Second Join

It might be necessary, on a player's first re-join when that they qualify for a reward, to again disable the chat and provide some story elements that explain what the reward is and how they get it. Maybe chat will automatically enable after a few seconds of these story messages being sent?

Messages:
- You found gold while you were away!
- When you log off, your character goes on an expedition and can return with spoils
- The longer you are away, the longer the expedition, and the better the spoils (up to 48 hours)
- Use /jrewards claim to claim your spoils!

## Subsequent Joins

Any time they join and qualify for a reward, they should somehow know to claim it. We don't want to lose the experience/story we've built the first 2 times they joined, but we don't want to interrupt their gameplay anymore.

## World Behavior

Random mob spawns should be "bosses" that are harder to kill and drop better rewards. Can we make the "bosses" more difficult depending on who it spawned near? (Based on their experience level)

Some sort of mystery that needs to be solved, or somehow told throughout their playtime, that explains WHY they randomly woke up somewhere strange?
