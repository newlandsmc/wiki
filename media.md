Notes:

I want the banner to look like the PvPBubble one (same animation for text appearing, same contrast between the background and text, and same way that the logo appears in the center at the beginning) PLUS the transition between each slide like the MassVille one (where the text scrolls down and the background moves with it)

I do NOT want the IP in the corner of the banner. Instead, i want it to be the last slide. So it'll be like:
- Logo
- <text 1>
- <text 2>
- <text 3>
- play.semivanilla.com

## Logo
Artist: RadoiFlorin (radoiflorin.designer#0989)

Notes:

The server is called “SemiVanilla MC”. We own the domain semivanilla.com, website isn’t published yet. It will be a pretty simple server, only offering the classic survival game mode with some RPG elements that don’t alter the game too much.

I was thinking vanilla ice cream, somehow modified to be “semi vanilla” would be cool for a logo.

Maybe the logo could be a chocolate dipped I cream cone with a scoop of vanilla on top, and the words “SemiVanilla MC” over top of it

No MC characters in the logo.

## Server Icon

Notes:

The server is called “SemiVanilla MC”. We own the domain semivanilla.com, website isn’t published yet. It will be a pretty simple server, only offering the classic survival game mode with some RPG elements that don’t alter the game too much.

The icon could be a scoop of vanilla ice cream with “SV” over top of it.
