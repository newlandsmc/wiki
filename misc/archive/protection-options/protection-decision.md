# Protection Decision

From discussion on 12/28/21 this is what we decided to do:

## PvP:
- Enabled
- Inconvenienced by death - see notes below
- Player traps are allowed (NOT IN THE WILD)
- Plugin - protects dropped on death AND logs their inventory on death

## Dynmap:
- Enabled
- Pregenerated and NEVER updated
    - Backup of it
- Players are shown with a radius around them

## Protection:
- LWCX
- Auto-protects placed chests
- Banners are NOT protected
- Claims on chests not opened in 6 months are deleted

## Rules:
- Player traps are NOT allowed in the wild
- Cheats, hacks, bots, and mods are NOT allowed
- Exploit glitches are not allowed
- No harassment, bullying, aggression, insults, threats, verbal abuse, hateful speech
    - Internal rule for thresholds on when pvp is harassment (5 times in half hour)
- Defrauding, trolling, win trading, and falsely reporting others is not allowed

## Notes:
- Players spawn at their last bed
    - random spawn around death? a way to find their death point?
        - spawn chest with their items (minus a penalty) + a piece of paper with coordinates as name
        - if you die in lava, the void... you respawn at your bed with nothing
