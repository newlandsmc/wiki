# Bungeecord Concept

When we need to support more players, we will need to switch to bungeecord.

The idea is to create 4 worlds, each with the same seed, and each one represents a different quadrant of the map. So you have -30k,-30k | 30k,-30k | 30k,30k | and -30k, 30k.

Maybe if we put the map tiles into the same folder from these, squaremap can show the whole world at once without any modifications.

"Local chat" is just their server. Global chat is all 4 servers.

Inventory syncs, teleport works between servers.

TAB shows current server ("region") and /list shows entire network
