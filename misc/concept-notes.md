## Discussion with Jess

- Custom McMMO-like leveling system
- Custom PVP handler - when you die you have a 10 second respawn cooldown, then you respawn right where you died. Your items are still yours, and you have a 60 second PvP buff to get revenge
- How to handle sleep - nerfing hunger if you don't sleep?
- How to handle Phantoms
- Vote system - instant finish expedition (like the rejoin rewards)
- Random boss mobs that glow, are more difficult to kill, and scale with player level
- How to make money - ranks, nicknames, what else?

## Discussion with Nathan

- Story that explains why you woke up somewhere randomly near a campfire. (Jess suggests just printing story lines as the player progresses like normal, like tying it to achievements)

## Discussion with Clay and Doom

- Player traps are not allowed
- All dropped items are protected so only the original player can pick them up
