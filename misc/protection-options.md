# Grief Protection Options

We need to decide how we will let players protect their builds/items. We must consider Dynmap and PvP settings when discussing these (other things to consider add here).

## There are 3 Potential Choices:

- **GriefPrevention:**
    - Players earn virtual "claim blocks" (number of 1x1 columns they can claim) and use a golden shovel to create rectangular claims that automatically extend up to build limit and down to the lowest part of their build.
    - Pros: Complete protection of anything inside the claims. Allows mining below the claim. Has an expiration system to remove old claims.
    - Cons: A bit clunky to use? Players have to earn "claim blocks" and are either limited in what they can claim, or they are allowed to claim too much for no reason.
- **LWCX:** 
    - Any chest players place down is automatically protected. They can /trust people to let those players access anything they have protected.
    - Pros: Easy to use, requires no action by players to have their things protected - entirely automated. Also, protects only essential blocks and leaves most of the world open for destruction.
    - Cons: Only protects inventory blocks. No build protection. No expiration system?
- **ProtectionStones:**
    - Players can "buy" protection stones, specific blocks they can place to protect a radius around that block.
    - Pros: Should work similar to GriefPrevention but without needing to create rectangular claims which some players struggle with, and without needing a golden shovel to use it.
    - Cons: Requires ugly blocks to be placed/hidden somewhere within your build. Also permanent? Hard to visualize the radius for larger blocks.

These are some options we have when we factor PvP and Dynmap into the mix:
