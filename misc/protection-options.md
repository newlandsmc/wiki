# Grief Protection Options

We need to decide how we will let players protect their builds/items. We must consider Dynmap and PvP settings when discussing these (other things to consider add here).

## Potential Plugins:

- **GriefPrevention:**
    - Players earn virtual "claim blocks" (number of 1x1 columns they can claim) and use a golden shovel to create rectangular claims that automatically extend up to build limit and down to the lowest part of their build.
    - Pros: Complete protection of anything inside the claims. Allows mining below the claim. Has an expiration system to remove old claims.
    - Cons: A bit clunky to use? Players have to earn "claim blocks" and are either limited in what they can claim, or they are allowed to claim too much for no reason.
- **LWCX:** 
    - Any chest players place down is automatically protected. They can /trust people to let those players access anything they have protected.
    - Pros: Easy to use, requires no action by players to have their things protected - entirely automated. Also, protects only essential blocks and leaves most of the world open for destruction.
    - Cons: Only protects inventory blocks. No build protection. No expiration system?
- **ProtectionStones:**
    - Players can "buy" protection stones, specific blocks they can place to protect a radius around that block.
    - Pros: Should work similar to GriefPrevention but without needing to create rectangular claims which some players struggle with, and without needing a golden shovel to use it.
    - Cons: Requires ugly blocks to be placed/hidden somewhere within your build. Also permanent? Hard to visualize the radius for larger blocks.

## Factors to Consider:

- If we have Dynmap then players can see where builds and other players are and target them for PvP or Griefing.
- If Raiding/Griefing unclaimed land is allowed, then players may not like only have LWC to protect their items...
    - ~~Unless that's part of the challenge, you need to hide your base?~~
- We could outlaw griefing, use CoreProtect to rollback any griefs, and still only use LWC for basic protection
    - But this requires a lot more involvement by staff and may be the least clean solution in the end for this reason

## Potential "Solutions":

These are some options we have for the big-picture idea when we factor PvP and Dynmap into the mix:

**Complete Global Protection**

Players can claim land to protect everything within it AND griefing is prohibited. Staff will need to rollback and griefs.

Consequence: Old abandoned buildings will be around forever (this is a good thing for historical items and monuments, but bad for your average hut).

Consequence: This potentially doesn't align with the more competitive RPG idea of the server, do we want to revisit the goal of the server?

Consequence: Duplication of items on rollback potentially

**Complete Self-Service Protection**

Players can claim land to protect everything within it. Griefing is allowed.

Consequence: Players complain and fight when they get griefed and are mad they didn't protect their stuff. (Staff burden)

**Item Protection**

Players can use LWC to protect their chests. This is completely automated on chest-place. Griefing is allowed and builds aren't protected.

Consequence: Players builds can be destroyed

Consequence: LWC protections never expire. Lots of chests will be around forever.

**Manual Protection**

Players can use LWC (or nothing) to protect their builds. Griefing is prohibited. Staff will need to rollback and griefs.

Consequence: Old abandoned buildings will be around forever (this is a good thing for historical items and monuments, but bad for your average hut).

Consequence: This potentially doesn't align with the more competitive RPG idea of the server, do we want to revisit the goal of the server?

Consequence: Lots of manual labor from staff rolling back griefs (staff burden)

Consequence: Duplication of items on rollback potentially
