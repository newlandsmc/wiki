# Seasons Concept

Every year we start a new "season" on the server. A new season comes with a world reset, updating MC if a new version is available, and potentially increasing AureliumSkills level caps or new MythicMobs.

We could make it so that new mythicmobs only spawn if your Aureliumskills is in the new higher levels.
  
We could make it like a mob-arena that's not a mob-arena - like if you do a certain action is triggers waves of enemies to come after you and it takes 15 minutes to fight through all of them. (Think Destiny 2)
