Survive the night, build your base, and conquer the dragon.

Watch out for other players, or team up with them.

Good luck!

Your pockets overflow with treasure.

When you are offline you complete expeditions.

The longer you are away, the further your character explores, and the more treasure you find.

Use /spoils to claim your treasure now!

It looks like someone else was here, and your pockets feel lighter than before...

The last thing you remember is blacking out.

When you die from most causes, you respawn nearby.
