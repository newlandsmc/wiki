# Boss Mobs

## Overview

"Random mob spawns are turned into "bosses" - they glow, they are harder to kill, and they drop better rewards. Their difficulty scales depending on who it spawned near (based on their PvE level)"

"The enderdragon randomly spawns somewhere in the end and compasses in the end point to the enderdragon. The enderdragon drops great rewards?"

## Behavior

The enderdragon should only spawn above islands, if possible.
