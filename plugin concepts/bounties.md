# Bounties

## Overview

When someone kills another player, they get a bounty on their head. The bounty lasts for a configurable amount of time (default 24 hours.)

If someone kills a bounty they get a reward - thinking 10 levels of vanilla XP. They do NOT get marked as a bounty for killing a bounty. The bounty is also removed from a bounty if they get killed.

A bounty should be marked in 3 ways:

- When they do the killing a message is sent out:

* <Victim> was slain...
* <Killer> has a bounty on their head!
  
- A suffix should be added to their name in TAB - "- bounty" in gold
  
- Their name above their head should be red OR have the same suffix
