# Disable Advancements

## Overview

**NEW 12/20/21: We want to rename this to "GameruleManager" and add a config so we can configure any gamerule and it's desired state.**

This plugin sets the announce-advancements gamerule to FALSE for every world on server startup, every time. This is needed because advancement announcements can only be disabled via a gamerule, which is somewhat volatile and can be reset under the right conditions. We want to make sure this is ALWAYS set to false.

## Behavior

On server startup, plugin sets ~~announce-advancements gamerule to FALSE for every world.~~ all configured gamerules.
