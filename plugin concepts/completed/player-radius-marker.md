# Player Radius Marker

## Overview

I'm using squaremap (https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap) for an online map of the server and I'd like to have players locations shown with a circle on the map, radius 500, with the center of the circle being a random set of coordinates within 500 blocks of them. (so you don't know where in the circle they are, just that they are in this general area).

## Config

- Radius: 500

## Notes

Clarification:

Anyone visiting the map will see all players. Instead of markers on the map showing exactly where each player is, red circles will appear on the map showing the general location of each player. These circles center points must be randomized so that you cannot intuit that the player is in the center of the circle, making the circles useless for hiding player location.
