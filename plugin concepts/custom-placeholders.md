# Custom Placeholders

## Overview

I'd like to be able to utilize PlaceholderAPI to put a message in TAB when an mcMMO booster is active. I can make Buycraft execute a command on package purchases, so if I had a plugin that could set the value of a variable via command, I could use that to modify the message in TAB.

I'd need a way to list multiple boosters if multiple are active, and also figure out what TAB would say when none are active.
