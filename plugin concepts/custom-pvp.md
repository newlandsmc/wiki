# RPG Levels

## Overview

"A custom PvP system means that whenever you are killed, there is a 10 second respawn cooldown. You will respawn where you died and receive a large skills buff that gives you the advantage over the killer in case you want to get revenge. Your items are also protected so you will get your items back."
