# Custom PVP

## Overview

"A custom PvP system means that whenever you are killed, there is a 10 second respawn cooldown. You will respawn where you died and receive a large skills buff that gives you the advantage over the killer in case you want to get revenge."

"Your items are protected when you die, so only you can pick them up"

## Notes

Rewards?:

Should players get rewards when they kill somebody? This could make the "player tracker" items PTW. If we implement this, there will be a 12 hour cooldown between getting a reward from the same player.

Nerf the killers:

When you kill someone, you can't teleport for 60 seconds and you can't become buffed.

Explanation:

The first time this happens, it will be explained to them what is happening.

How to limit the back and forth?

If a player gets killed 3 times then it will ask the player being killed if they would like to /report the player for harassment. If they do /report then it will disable pvp between those 2 players for 1 hour. The /reports are logged for staff to review and staff can take action if a pattern is noticed.
