# Help

## Overview

Listens to a long list of commands and opens a GUI that contains all information in one spot. Some GUI options open links, others open books in-game.

## Behavior

Any of the commands below open a GUI with the following icons: store (emerald), map (map), vote (netherstar), website (campfire), discord (amethyst), rules (banner pattern), help (book).

Store opens link to: https://store.semivanilla.com
Map opens link to: https://semivanilla.com/map
Vote opens link to: https://semivanilla.com/vote
Website opens link to: https://semivanilla.com
Discord opens link to: https://discord.gg/3WzZ3x6wGp
Rules opens link to: https://semivanilla.com/rules
Help opens a book

**Update**: Links will open a book. Preferably, all of this content is stored in the same book, and each GUI open opens the relevant page of said book.

Need config for the help book that supports color codes and new lines
