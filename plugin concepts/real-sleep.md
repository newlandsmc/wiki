# Real Sleep

## Overview

"A sleep plugin gives sleeping a purpose on large servers - your max health is reduced by 1 heart 3 nights that you don't sleep. The hearts are removed at dawn, you take instant damage to cause the "take damage sound" and a message appears in chat that says "You grow weaker due to lack of sleep...""

~~"Phantoms are disabled."~~ - Gamerule can handle this.

~~"The amount of players that need to sleep should be configurable. Possible messages in chat that say how many players are sleeping and how many still need to sleep?"~~ - Gamerule can handle this.
