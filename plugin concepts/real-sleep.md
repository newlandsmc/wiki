# Real Sleep

## Overview

"A sleep plugin gives sleeping a purpose on large servers - your max health is reduced by 1 heart 3 nights that you don't sleep. The hearts are removed at dawn, you take instant damage to cause the "take damage sound" and a message appears in chat that says "You grow weaker due to lack of sleep...""

"Phantoms are disabled."

"The amount of players that need to sleep should be configurable. Possible messages in chat that say how many players are sleeping and how many still need to sleep?"
