# Respawn Handler 2.0

## Overview

When players die a corpse appears where they died, and contains their items, unless an item had the "soulbound" enchant, then they keep it. They respawn at their bed, which is a vanilla behavior.

## Behavior

- Custom soulbound enchant let's people keep their items when they die
- Corpse spawns at their death point - last 3 corpses per player, and they stay for 48 hours or until they are completely looted
- Corpse can only be looted by the dead player for the first 10 minutes. A nametag should display a countdown until it's unlocked
- After the 10 minutes, the nametag should switch to a countdown to when it despawns
- A message should die when they respawn that can be customized, so we can use it to explain the corpse and soulbound system
