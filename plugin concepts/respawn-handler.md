# Respawn Handler

## Overview

Players spawn in a random location within a certain radius of their death when they die. A chest appears next to them with their items in it, as well as a paper named with the coordinates they died.

If the player had some gems or ores, they lose 33% of them.

If a player died by lava or void, then they respawn at their last bed with no items.
