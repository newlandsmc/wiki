# Story Mode

## Overview

This plugin will mute the chat when a player first joins so they can focus on the story messages provided to them in chat. It will also mute it when they join a second time, for the same reason. It will also be the plugin to provide those story messages?

## Behavior

To be determined.

## Commands

- \<chat unmute\>

## Messages

To be determined.

## Config

To be determined.

## Notes

Potential overlap of projects:

This might make sense to be part of the rejoin-rewards plugin and join-handler plugin, since they all relate to actions done when a player joins...
